= Test Notifier

Inspired by http://railstips.org/2007/7/23/autotest-growl-pass-fail-notifications

After using Growl notification, I decided to write my own plugin because I have
to work on Ubuntu and Mac OS X and I missed the notification on my Linux box.
This plugin works with Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. All you need to do is
install the specific notification library for your OS.

Instead of displaying lots of notifications for each failure, I prefer to be
notified about the whole test result (you'll have to check your log
file anyway in order to clean up the failures/errors).

== Installation

  gem install test_notifier

Check http://github.com/fnando/notifier to see how you can configure a notifier for your OS.

== Usage

If you're using Test::Unit you should add <tt>require "test_notifier/runner/test_unit"</tt> to your <tt>test_helper.rb</tt> file.

If you're using RSpec you should add <tt>require "test_notifier/runner/spec"</tt> to your <tt>spec_helper.rb</tt> file. If you're using RSpec 2, you need to add <tt>require "test_notifier/runner/rspec"</tt> instead.

If you're using Autotest you should add <tt>require test_notifier/runner/autotest"</tt> to
the file <tt>~/.autotest</tt>

You can define your notifier.

  TestNotifier.default_notifier = :growl

The available notifiers are <tt>:growl</tt>, <tt>:kdialog</tt>, <tt>:knotify</tt>, <tt>:notify_send</tt>, <tt>:osd_cat</tt>, and <tt>:snarl</tt>.
